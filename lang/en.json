  "aboutmespeak": "<p>Hello, my name is <strong>Jason Haudot</strong>, and I’m passionate about the digital world, particularly in development and design.</p><p>Since my teenage years, I’ve been experimenting with coding and graphic design through personal projects. Over time, I’ve self-taught and developed my skills with the goal of building a professional path independently.</p><p>My first steps in the web world began with forum creation. There, I discovered technical constraints as well as the importance of design. Due to limited resources and curiosity at the time, I mainly focused on the visual aspects of websites — a passion that still drives me today, and which I now want to fully combine with web and mobile development.</p><p>My journey led me to explore other fields, but that period only strengthened my motivation to return to my original passion with a clearer vision and purpose.</p><p>It was through the DAQ and the technical platforms at <a href='https://numericabfc.com/' target='_blank'>Numérica-BFC</a> that the spark reignited. Encouraged by dedicated trainers, I decided to seriously pursue Web and Mobile Web Development.</p><p>Through this interactive and responsive Resume, I invite you to discover my background, my skills, and what drives me daily. Feel free to contact me if my profile interests you — I’d be glad to connect.</p><p style ='text-align:right'>Sincerely,<br>Jason Haudot</p>",
