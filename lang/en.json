    "aboutmespeak": "<p>Hello, my name is <strong>Jason</strong>, and from a very young age I’ve been interested in computer science. Like many kids my age, I dreamed of creating video games. Later on, I became interested in graphic design and illustration, and today I’m teaching myself how to code. I want to take this learning further in a professional way and build a solid foundation in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p> <p>My hobbies often revolve around 2D/3D animation, board games, and art. I never run out of imagination!</p> <p>I’m a beginner, but highly motivated. I want to turn this passion into a career by building on my current skills, constantly improving them, and contributing to exciting projects as part of a dynamic team.</p> <p>This interactive and responsive resume was created after my professional training at Numérica. I worked on it a little every day during my diploma course. I hope you enjoy reading it.</p> <p style='text-align: right; margin-bottom: 0;'>Best regards,</p> <p style='text-align: right;'><strong>Jason Haudot</strong></p>"
